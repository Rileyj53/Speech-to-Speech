# Speech to Speech
This file is a little program I made that uses IBM Watson to translate an audio recording in English (or any language) into an audio recording in Spanish (or any language). This is accomplished by first creating a transcript of the original file and translating the transcript into the desired language. It then uses text-to-speech to create a new audio file in the translated language. This was a project for IFT 360 - Aplications in AI.
